    <h1>Not Terrible Learning</h1>
    <p style="font-family: Arial">Welcome, students, to NTL—Not Terrible Learning—where learning is made not terrible!<br>
        <br>
        Are you tired of long textbooks that could convey the same information in just a few pages? Websites that—on the contrary—give such bare bones information that you came out with nothing more than you went in? Apps that reap off of poor students by charging an arm and a leg for half the damn features? AP guides that mass produce practice questions rather than quality and reflective AP-style questions?<br> 
        <br>
        If so, you’ve come to the right place.<br>
        <br>
        Here, there is the perfect balance between concise and depth. Chapters are often no longer than a few pages long, but each chapter will go into all the necessary details. <br>
        <br>
        All AP guides were written with research into the official CEDs of the course to ensure that all content displayed on this site is necessary and no required content is missed.<br>
        <br>
        “But what makes this different from the thousands of other student resources?” you may be wondering. <br>
        <br>
        Let’s set one thing straight: I am burnt the hell out. How is that a good thing for you and the quality of my site?<br>
        <br>
        Well first, that means I know best exactly how to minmax learning. I’m at the point where I’m not trying to learn or do anything more than I have to, and neither should you. Learning is all about working smarter, not harder—knowing when to cut corners and recognizing small patterns that teachers fail to point out. That’s what the site will be about. I will share both the content and the tips to get around difficulties, small details and hints for various courses that aren’t taught that me or people I know have picked up.<br>
        <br>
        Second, that means I have no reason to make this site another generic textbook-esque info-dump. There’s a ton of those already. They’re inherently more info-heavy which may work better for you, and if that’s the case you do you. But I’ll bet most people don’t want to go through such a resource, the same way I don’t wanna just regurgitate what I already know to write this website.<br>
        <br>
        What that leads me to say is that tone is important for learning. You learn better when something is in your language. I wanted to make this more entertaining for myself to write, so I never held back in just talking like how I might usually talk. This makes this site much more approachable and entertaining to read. <br>
        <br>
        Third, this site is my last chance to do something highly impactful to carry my college applications. My ass is not about to try to join Science Olympiad or get an engineering internship senior year all because I didn’t know how to play the college app game until it was too late and spent too much of my high school career doing writing and crap when I’m going into STEM. This website is my failsafe so you best believe I’m doing everything in my power to try to make it successful, including making sure its quality is top notch and helps it stand out among the thousands of others.<br>
        <br>
        So, with all that said, I hope you stick around. You won’t regret it. <br>
